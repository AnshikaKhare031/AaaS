            1. Handcrafted Product Variations
          </h3>
          <p>
            All products listed in our store are hand-knitted, crocheted, or hand-assembled by our skilled artisans. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 font-medium text-[#25382E]">
            Due to this handcrafted production process, there may be minor variations in stitch tension, yarn hues, textures, or sizes compared to the product photos shown on our website. These variations are not defects; they are the natural hallmark of handmade craftsmanship and ensure that every item you purchase is a unique piece of art.
