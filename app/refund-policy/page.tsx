          At AaaS, we put our heart into creating unique handmade crochet products for you. Because of the bespoke, artisanal nature of our creations, we follow a balanced return, cancellation, and refund process.
        </p>

        {/* Section 1 */}
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h3 className="font-serif font-bold text-[#25382E] text-lg md:text-xl border-b border-[#E5DACB] pb-2">
            1. Order Cancellations
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can request a cancellation and a full refund within **12 hours** of placing your order, provided the piece has not yet entered production or been packed for delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Once an order is packed or dispatched, we cannot accept cancellation requests. To request a cancellation, please email us with your Order Number as soon as possible.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Section 2 */}
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h3 className="font-serif font-bold text-[#25382E] text-lg md:text-xl border-b border-[#E5DACB] pb-2">
            2. Damaged or Incorrect Products
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the rare event that your handmade creation arrives damaged in transit or if we deliver the wrong design:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>Please contact us within **24 hours** of receiving the parcel.</li>
            <li>We request you to share clear photographs or a short video showing the damaged package/item or wrong product. A parcel opening video is highly appreciated to help us raise damage claims with courier agencies.</li>
            <li>Upon verifying the issue, we will craft and dispatch a replacement item at no additional charge. If a replacement cannot be made (e.g. out of yarn stock), we will issue a full refund.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        {/* Section 3 */}
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h3 className="font-serif font-bold text-[#25382E] text-lg md:text-xl border-b border-[#E5DACB] pb-2">
            3. Customized & Personalized Items
          </h3>
          <p>
            Orders for customized crochet heirlooms and bespoke colorways cannot be cancelled or returned once crocheting has started. This is because these pieces are handcrafted specifically to your requirements and cannot be restocked. They are only eligible for replacement or refund if damaged during transit.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Section 4 */}
        <div className="space-y-2">

            4. Nature of Handmade Art
          </h3>
          <p>
            Please note that minor stitch variations, slight nuances in organic yarn coloring, and artisanal handmade details are normal characteristics of handmade items. We do not accept returns or refunds based on these organic variances.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Section 5 */}
        <div className="space-y-2">

            5. Refund Process & Timelines
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once a cancellation request or a damage-related refund is approved:
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The refund will be processed back to the original source bank account or credit card utilized during checkout. Payments are routed back securely via **Razorpay** and typically reflect in your account within **5 to 7 business days** (depending on bank settlement schedules).
          </p>
        </div>
